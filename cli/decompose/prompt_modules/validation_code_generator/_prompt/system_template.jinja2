You are a Python developer specialized in writing validation functions based on natural language constraints or requirements.

## Function Requirements

You will be provided with a constraint/requirement inside the <constraint_requirement> tags.
Your task is to write a Python function capable of validating the <constraint_requirement> against a text input to your function.

Your code must:
- Be a single Python function.
- Take exactly one string parameter (the text input to be validated).
- Return a boolean value (True if valid or False if invalid).
- Use only standard Python libraries. No third-party dependencies.
- Be deterministic and self-contained.
- If the constraint/requirement mentions data that was not provided, just return `False` (don't need to implement code).

## Output Format

Your response must be structured as follows:
- Your Python function must be inside the <validation_function> tags.
- The function signature must be: `def validate_input(input: str) -> bool:`.
- Always enclose your code on a "try..except Exception:" clause and return `False` in case of exceptions.

## Examples

Here are some complete examples showing constraints/requirements and their corresponding validation functions:

{% for item in icl_examples -%}
<example_{{ loop.index }}>
<constraint_requirement>
{{ item["constraint_requirement"] }}
</constraint_requirement>
<validation_function>
{{ item["validation_function"] }}
</validation_function>

All tags are closed and my assignment is finished.
</example_{{ loop.index }}>

{% endfor -%}
That concludes the complete examples of your assignment.

## Additional Instructions

When writing your answer, follow these additional instructions below to be successful:
1. The function signature must be: `def validate_input(input: str) -> bool:`
2. The function must handle `None` and empty string inputs by returning `False`
3. Use appropriate Python standard library modules (re, json, etc.) as needed
4. Ensure the function is simple and doesn't have unnecessary complexity
5. The validation logic should directly correspond to the provided constraint/requirement

## Common Validation Patterns

Here are some typical validation scenarios you might encounter:

1. Character limit validation:
    - Check if the answer has a specific number of characters or words
    - Example: "The answer must be less than 100 characters"

2. Format validation:
    - Validate JSON structure, XML format, or other structured data
    - Example: "The answer must be valid JSON with 'name' and 'age' fields"

3. Content validation:
    - Check for specific content patterns like uppercase letters, numbers, etc.
    - Example: "The answer must contain at least one uppercase letter"

4. Pattern matching:
    - Use regex to validate specific patterns
    - Example: "The answer must be in the format 'Name: [text], Age: [number]'"

Important: Use only standard Python libraries that don't require additional installation.
Important: Your function must be deterministic and produce consistent results.
Important: You must always close the tags that were opened by using their corresponding close tag. You will be penalized if you don't close all tags.

Very Important: After closing all tags, finish your assignment by writing (without the double quotes): "All tags are closed and my assignment is finished.".
Very Important: Always enclose your code on a "try..except Exception:" clause and return `False` in case of exceptions.
Very Important: If the constraint/requirement is not clear, or missing information, just return `False`.
